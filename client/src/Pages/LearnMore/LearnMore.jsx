    "A land acknowledgment is a statement that recognizes the traditional territories of Indigenous peoples and their relationship with the land. Itâ€™s a way to honor their history, culture, and ongoing presence. More than just words, it reflects a commitment to respect, reconciliation, and shared stewardship of the land. By learning about and practicing land acknowledgments, we acknowledge the past, recognize current realities, and commit to meaningful actions that support Indigenous communities.",
    "Land acknowledgments recognize the traditional territories of Indigenous peoples and honor their enduring connection to the land. They raise awareness of histories and treaties that are often overlooked, fostering respect and understanding. By acknowledging the land, we take a step toward reconciliation, showing commitment to learning from and supporting Indigenous communities. These statements remind us of our shared responsibility to care for the land and contribute to ongoing efforts for justice and equity.",
    "In a land acknowledgment, the term 'unceded' refers to land that has not been legally transferred or signed away by Indigenous peoples to colonial or settler governments.",
